\begin{abstract}
A Large Ion Collider Experiment (ALICE) has been conceived and constructed as a heavy-ion experiment at the LHC. During LHC runs 1 and 2, it has produced a wide range of physics results based using all collision systems available at the LHC.
In order to best exploit new physics opportunities opening up with the upgraded LHC and new detector technologies, the experiment has undergone a major upgrade during the LHC long shutdown 2. This comprises the move to continuous read-out, the complete overhaul of core detectors, as well as a new processing software stack and hardware. 
These improvements will allow us to sample Pb-Pb collisions at rates up to \SI{50}{\kilo\hertz}, while ensuring sensitivity for signals without a triggerable signature.
