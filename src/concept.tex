\section{Upgrade objectives, motivations and goals (10 p.)}

In this section, we explain the motivation for the LS2 upgrades and the
resulting requirements for the detectors and the read-out chain.

\subsection{Physics performance (Marco, Jochen)}

physics goals for Run 3/4, refer to yellow report and TDRs~\cite{Citron:2018lsq}

significant increase of interaction rate needed (not possible with gated TPC)

rare probes, which cannot be triggered on (low pt, no unique signature)

maintaining PID capabilities

\subsection{System design (Werner, Alex)}
\begin{itemize}
\item Radiation tolerance/load
\item continuous read-out, no filtering but compression (general description), TF and its related impact on reconstruction, CTP-CRU-FLP-EPN approach, implementation specification (beam, particle load, radiation load)
\end{itemize}
