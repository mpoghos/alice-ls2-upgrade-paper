\section{Upgrade objectives, motivations and goals}
\subsection{physics/performance objectives}
\subsection{requirements on implementations/overall system design}
\begin{itemize}
\item Radiation tolerance/load
\item continuous read-out, no filtering but compression (general description), TF and its related impact on reconstruction, CTP-CRU-FLP-EPN approach, implementation specification (beam, particle load, radiation load)
\end{itemize}
