@article{Pshenichnov2011,
abstract = {Electromagnetic interactions of high-energy nuclei in ultraperipheral collisions are considered. Such collisions, which take place without any overlap of nuclear densities, can be considered as irradiation of nuclei by intense photon beams with a broad energy spectrum. This leads to several unusual phenomena, such as mutual electromagnetic excitation of nuclei, including exotic double and triple excitations of giant resonances, and multifragmentation of nuclei. The RELDIS model is presented, which describes fragmentation of nuclei and meson production by equivalent photons. It is shown that the RHIC and LHC colliders provide unique opportunities to study electromagnetic interactions of ultrarelativistic nuclei. The cross sections calculated by the RELDIS model are used in the method of monitoring the LHC luminosity on the basis of neutron emission rates, as well as to simulate interactions of beam nuclei with LHC construction elements.},

abstract = {We study mutual dissociation of heavy nuclei in peripheral collisions at ultrarelativistic energies. Earlier this process was proposed for beam luminosity monitoring via simultaneous registration of forward and backward neutrons in zero degree calorimeters at Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider. Electromagnetic dissociation of heavy ions is considered in the framework of the Weizsacker-Williams method and simulated by the RELDIS code. Photoneutron cross sections measured in different experiments and calculated by the GNASH code are used as input for the calculations of dissociation cross sections. The difference in results obtained with different inputs provides a realistic estimation for the systematic uncertainty of the luminosity monitoring method. Contribution to simultaneous neutron emission due to grazing nuclear interactions is calculated within the abrasion model. Good description of CERN SPS experimental data on Au and Pb dissociation gives confidence in predictive power of the model for AuAu and PbPb collisions at RHIC and LHC.},
