\subsection{Muon System}

The forward muon arm has been described in ~\cite{Aamodt:2008zz} . It consists of a
composite absorber ($\sim 10\ \lambda_{int}$), made with layers of
both high- and low-Z materials starting 90 cm from the mean
interaction point, a large dipole magnet with a 3 Tm integrated field
placed outside the L3 barrel magnet, and ten planes of very thin, high
granularity, cathode pad tracking stations. A second muon filter
($\sim 7\ \lambda_{int}$ of iron) at the end of the spectrometer and
four planes of Resistive Plate Chambers are used for muon
identification. The spectrometer is shielded by a dense conical
absorber tube, of about 60 cm outer diameter, which protects the
chambers from secondary particles created in the beam pipe.

The increase of luminosity of the LHC after LS2 requires an upgrade of
the front-end and read-out electronics on both muon
tracking and muon identifier subsystems.
